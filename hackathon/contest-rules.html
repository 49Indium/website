<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Hackathon is a competition, administered by the UQ Computing Society Hackathon committee. The judging panel will be made up of the Hackathon committee and industry sponsors as appropriate for each prize.</p>

<p>All decisions made by the judging panel will be considered final, with no further correspondence being entered into. This is a competition of skill; chance does not play any part in the competition.</p>

<p>Competing teams will have a maximum of four (4) people. Each team will nominate one person to liaise with the Hackathon committee, to ensure all other team members receive announcements from the organisers and that all relevant information is kept updated.</p>

<h2>Judging Criteria</h2>

<p>Each team is required to submit a number of items with their competition entry. These items shall include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>A project description:</strong> A page on the Hackathon website, with team member names, information about their project and which categories they are nominating for.</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes from the project:</strong> Teams shall make available any code, graphics, websites, applications, etc that have been used for the project. The code should be stored on a version control system, as either a public or private repository. The Hackathon committee shall be given read access to all repositories, for the purposes of judging.</li>
</ul><p>Entries to the competition will be judged by the Hackathon Judging Panel against criteria including:</p>

<ul><li>Originality</li>
<li>Relevance to the nominated category definition</li>
<li>Quality and Design (including standard compliance)</li>
<li>Usability and accessibility (including documentation)</li>
</ul><h2>Timing</h2>

<p>The Hackathon will run over two days, starting Saturday 8 August 2015 and concluding Sunday 9 August 2015. Teams may register any time before the close of the competition, but may not commence work on their project until the opening of the competition on the morning of Saturday 1 August 2015.</p>

<p>Submissions must be received before 5:30pm Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) on Sunday 9 August 2015. This submission shall include all items as specified in the Judging Criteria. No requests for extensions will be granted. </p>

<p>Judging will take place in the week after the competition. Public voting will take place during this week, in order to determine the winner of the People’s Choice award. The Judging Panel will determine all other prizes for the competition. Winners shall be announced no later than two (2) weeks following the conclusion of the competition.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>At least one team member must be over the age of 18. Each team shall have a minimum of one (1) UQ Computing Society member (as this is a UQ Computing Society competition). Individuals may become a member of the UQ Computing Society at any point in time before the conclusion of the competition. A person may only be a member of one team within the competition.</p>

<p>Entries are expected to be developed during the weekend of Hackathon. If it is found that an entry was developed before the weekend, that submission will be deemed ineligible for prizes. Use or extension of existing software, libraries or data sets is permitted. Please consult the Hackathon committee if you are unsure whether software, libraries or data sets may be ruled invalid.</p>
