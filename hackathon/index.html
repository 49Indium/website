    <p>The UQ Computing Society Hackathon is a competition to show off your design and coding skills over a weekend, while in the company of other likeminded people. </p>

<h3>What is Involved?</h3>

<p>Teams of up to four people will develop an application, be it web, mobile or desktop based. Judges will then use your app, take a look at your code, and decide on winners for the categories available. The competition will be held at The University of Queensland's St Lucia campus.</p>

<h3>It sounds interesting, but I am not a good coder...</h3>

<p>Don't worry! You don't have to be the world's best programmer to participate in the Hackathon - you just need to have fun. We know that everyone has different abilities, and we will have prize categories to cater for all. You could contribute by designing the user interface, setting up a database or planning out the system design. </p>
