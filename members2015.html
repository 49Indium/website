          <h5>UQCS is a great way to meet like-minded people in a fun enviornment. We have a wide range

          <h2>Hackathon</h2>
          <h4 class="subheader">2015 is seeing the return of our flagship event, the UQCS Hackathon.</h4>
          <p>Teams will compete over several days to design and write an app, be it mobile, desktop or web based, that
          assists students or the wider community. This could be a new tool for students,
          or tapping into a public dataset and making it visible and accessible to more people.</p>
          <p>The Hackathon will be held on the weekend of 8-9 August. Full details are available at the
          <a href="http://uqcs.org.au/hackathon">Hackathon website</a>.</p>

          <p>Held on a fortnightly basis, UQCS Tech Meetups are an opportunity

              <p>Like programming? UQCS has a number of projects planned for 2015.
			  We've open sourced everything we use, from the website, to our accounting.
              We will provide training for the languages and tools we use throughout the year, so this
              is a great way to learn something new and contribute to a group coding project.</p>

              Topics planned for 2015 include: Functional programming, the Open Source movement,
			  an introduction to LaTeX, vim, and the return of our 2014
              Introduction to Version Control (Git/Github/Bitbucket) and Introduction to
              GNU/Linux talk.</p>
              <p>These are just some of the topics currently planned, and naturally

          <p>Everyone likes to chill out, so UQCS has organised some events to
          help you do just that! In 2015, we have added new games nights,
          as well as drinks to help you wind down at the end of the semester.</p>

              <p>Think you were hard done by with some marking? Looking for a bit of
              revenge on those who marked it? Well look no further!</p>
              <p>UQCS runs regular games between students and ITEE Staff. Previous
              games have been Team Fortress 2 and Open Arena, but we are looking to
              expand this year and appeal to a wider variety of gamers. All you need is
              the game being played, a UQCS membership, and then showing up on time to
              the server. Details are given out in advance of each session.</p>

              else you would like to bring along, there will be plenty of games to choose from.
              And to make sure you don't go hungry, there will be food and drinks available throughout the night.</p>
