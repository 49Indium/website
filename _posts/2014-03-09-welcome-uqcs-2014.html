title: Welcome to UQCS for 2014
---
<p>The UQ Computing Society Executive would like to welcome all new members for 2014. To kick off the year, all members are invited to attend our Welcome to UQCS event, which is free for members.</p>

<p>The aim is to introduce you to our Executive for this year, as well as outline some of the events we have coming up - not to mention a chance for you to meet other computing students. Of course, an event like this would not be complete without free pizza for all members who attend!</p>
