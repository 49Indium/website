title: Introduction to Git
---
<p>So you have heard of that 'Git' thing, and look at GitHub all the time, but do you actually know what it is? Maybe you have tried Git before, but want to know how to branch and merge better?</p>
<p>The solution is to come to our Introduction to Git seminar, of course! We will go over what Git is and how to use it from both the command line and GUI clients. We will also talk about different types of Git repository setups, and how you can more effectively use branches and merge them back into master.</p>
<p>Following the seminar, we will have a FREE PIZZA dinner, before playing some board games!</p>
