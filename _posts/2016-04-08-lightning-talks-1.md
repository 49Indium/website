First up was Elliot Smith a UQ alumni (2012) and founder and CEO of HSK Instruments, a Brisbane startup focused on developing medical devices for respiratory physiotherapy. Elliot highlighted the importance of feedback during development and maintenance of anything from a small project to an actual start up business. His systematic breakdown of the major stages in this process highlighted that forced feedback, which focuses on statistics and direct user feedback, is just as important as automated feedback generated by the many tools available online. Whether you were working on a small individual project or aiming to create a big startup, it was easy to see Elliot’s advice came from his own experience in developing his now thriving and constantly growing business at HSK.

Our second talk featured another UQ alumni, Dave Finster, currently the CTO of Docketbook which is a platform to replace the dated use of “dockets” in the construction industry. Dave’s talk focused on Docker - a platform on which developers can build and run their software with all dependencies and requirements bundled. Dave mentioned the differences and advantages of using virtualization and containers (Docker), with the low overhead of the latter being a big advantage. For upcoming developers, containers and images are an easier solution for maintaining efficiency during both development and production statements.

The last speaker of the night was UQCS President, Tom Manderson, a third year Software Engineering/Math student. As you may have seen recently, Google’s AlphaGo (AI) succeeded in beating Lee Sedol in a few matches of the board game Go. The key reason this has made the rounds recently is that it has reminded us that AI is something we need to be discussing.
