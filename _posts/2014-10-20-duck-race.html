<p>We all know how useful <strong>Rubber Duck Debugging</strong>&nbsp;is for programming. With the recent influx of ducks across GP South at UQ, from CSSE2310 to the ITLC tutors, we thought it was appropriate to go one step further and participate in the <strong>Brisbane Duck Race</strong>, to support the PA Research Foundation.</p>

<p>The UQ Computing Society, along with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ITLCtutors">ITLC tutors</a>, CSSE2310 tutors and <a href="http://uqattic.net/">UQAttic</a> encourage you to <strong>donate to this wonderful cause</strong>. We will be participating in the duck race on Sunday 26 October, which should be a lot of fun for everyone to get involved in. You might see some more duck related merchandise and information around GP South over the next two weeks, so please check it out and get involved!</p>
