title: Seminar on Pervade and Hypervade
---
We would like to thank David Gwynne for presenting a talk on Pervade. If you missed out on the seminar, or would like to learn more, please <a href="http://mild.embarrassm.net/~dlg/pervade/#/">check out the slides from his presentation.</a>

<p>On Monday 24 March, we'll be hosting the first UQCS seminar of the year.  The topic for this talk will be the Pervade system, and it will be presented by David Gwynne, an Infrastructure Architect here at UQ.  Pervade is a computer imaging system using the BitTorrent protocol, developed within the EAIT Faculty IT and Infrastructure Group.  Pervade is currently used by EAIT to perform the imaging of the many computers within the faculty.  David will also discuss the future of Pervade, including Hypervade, a hypervisor running in some labs at UQ.  So, make sure you come along and learn about a unique and novel way to solve a common problem, developed and deployed, right here at UQ!</p>
