title: Board Games Night
---
<p>We know that people like to play games. To complement our Staff vs Students Video Games series, the UQ Computing Society is introducing a new way to have fun: Board Games Nights!</p>
<p>Our inaugural night of board games will be on Tuesday 12 August. We will start off with FREE PIZZA for dinner, then move on to playing games. We will have a range of games available, and you are encouraged to bring along games that you would like to play on the night. Invite your friends to come along and join in - the more the merrier.</p><!--more-->
<p>Preceding the board games will be our <a title="Intro to Git" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-08-10-intro-git  %}">Intro to Git</a> seminar, so be sure to come along to both for an evening of learning and fun.</p>
