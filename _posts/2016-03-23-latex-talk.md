Once again, Dr. Joel's LaTeX talk has been a success - many thanks to those who
attended and especially Dr. Joel for giving the talk! Slides from the talk can
be found below:

As LaTeX is generally not picked up from one talk there is luckily plenty of
resources online which can assist you on your LaTeX journey but more importantly
you can find #latex on the UQCS Slack where you can get help and ask questions.
