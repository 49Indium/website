2016 for the UQ Computing Society has started off big! In just five hours on market day, 200 of you signed up, doubling last years market day registrations, and more than last years total number of members. On the day, UQCS’s custom payment suffered a few minor glitches however it reduced membership registrations from 3+ minutes to a mere 90 seconds!

### Launch Event

Our first event was a casual meet and greet during week one of semester. More than half our members turned up and enjoyed pizza whilst meeting students from other disciplines and programs. The following week, UQCS teamed up with the Video Games Society (VGS) and QUGS (Queensland University Games Society) to co-host a four hour gaming session with even more pizza, of course.

### Our Sponsors
Atlassian, one of Australia's largest tech companies (&#36;319 million revenue), came to town in week two to talk about version control with git - discussing software engineering best practises in industry as well as the software they develop such as Bitbucket, for maintaining git repositories and their famous issue tracking software - Jira.
Atlassian is one of our 5 key sponsors, the others being:

+ **Accenture** - *a global management consultancy firm focusing on tech services.*
+ **iLab** - *a UQ owned startup incubator.*
+ **Tanda** - *who produce timesheet and attendance software.*
+ **Polymathian** - *specialise in optimising industry problems from a mathematical standpoint.*

These four sponsors will be getting further involved in our upcoming events including industry talks and our Hackathon (coming up in semester two)! 


### Hackathons
Hackathons are generally 48hr events in which a people rush to develop some form or “working” product. They are a fantastic opportunity for local developers to meet, have fun and potentially tackle industry problems innovatively all while being fed well and having fun! Our year kicked off with several UQCS members representing us at the second Unearthed Hackathon in Brisbane (stay tuned for a more detailed post).

If you missed out on Unearthed don’t worry, on the ANZAC long weekend (April 22-23), Tanda is celebrating the release of their API by holding a Hackathon based on timesheeting and payroll. If that’s not enough to tickle your interest, all proceeds support student clubs and societies like us. Even if you don’t hack on the day, drop by to network with other programmers! 


### Coming Up
Before commencing the mid-semester break, UQCS is pairing up with the Electrically Based Engineering Student Society (EBESS) for our annual LaTeX talk given by Dr. Joel Fenwick. LaTex is a powerful typesetting and markup language that lets you focus on content rather than formatting by automatically generating beautiful documents and presentations. It is often used by lecturers and thesis students to format all those nasty equations that would take hours of fiddling with in other word processing software. This is a must-have skill that will save you many hours of formatting down the track.
