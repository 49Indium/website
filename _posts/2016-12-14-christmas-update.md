Hey all,

Merry Christmas! We hope you're all having a fantastic holiday season and enjoying
a well earned break from uni. We've got a lot of exciting things lined up for next
year, and we'll make sure to keep you informed of what's going on!

## Shirt Designs
First off, we're running a design competition for next year's shirts. If you've got
something you want to see on UQCS shirts, submit an entry by the 13th of January.
Voting will then commence on the 15th of January for the shirts to be available from
Market Day next year.

## Public Meeting Minutes
We've decided to make the minutes of our executive meetings publicly available, and you can
<a href="https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/minutes">view them on GitHub.</a>
We believe this will help us be more transparent and accountable and provide insights into
how decisions are made and justified in the committee.

## Feedback and Housekeeping
A reminder: we now have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUcGp4TSnfUGHYsWEPYS2wcZSCff4dMfu2w-C6GgqLgRHocA/viewform">anonymous feedback form</a>
available for any concerns, queries or suggestions you want to share.

Also, on housecleaning matters, we've recently archived a number of channels on the UQCS
Slack which were related to Semester 2 subjects or otherwise not in use. We're also
getting very close to our file storage limit on Slack, so some cleaning up is required.
We will be going through and deleting older files in public channels, so if you have any
files in private channels or DMs that you aren't using, it would be very helpful if you
could delete those as well.

Lastly, thank you all for a great year! It was good to see so many new members join and
participate in our events. We look forward to the New Year and can't wait to see your
shirt design submissions!


PS. If you're not already on <a href="http://slack.uqcs.org.au">Slack</a> - get on it!
