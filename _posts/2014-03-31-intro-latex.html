<p>One of the most requested topics for seminars has been LaTeX, and we are only too happy to deliver. If you are not aware, <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is a document formatter and markup language. It allows you to focus on the content, and will automatically turn that into beautiful documents and presentations. So if you are working on a large written project (hint: a thesis), or want to find out how all those maths assignments are written, this is your chance to learn.</p>
<p>We are privileged to have Dr Joel Fenwick coming along to present this seminar. He has a great deal of experience using LaTeX, and will show you how to get started creating your own document masterpieces.</p>
