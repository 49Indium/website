title: Upcoming in Semester 2
---
Hi all! We hope you’ve been having a great break and have some exciting announcements.

First, we’ll be doing a stall on Semester 2 Market Day (Wednesday 29th July). Come down and say hi, or sign up if you’re not yet a member! $5 gets you full membership for the rest of the year. (You can also sign up at the Welcome Event.) Find out more about Market Day here: http://orientation.uq.edu.au/event/market-day

Second, we have our Week 1 Welcome Event the next day, Thursday 30th July. We’ll be hanging out and talking about our upcoming events for the semester. And there will be pizza. Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/1511033349187525/

Finally: Hackathon! Our annual Hackathon is on the weekend of Week 2, August 8–9. Now is the time to start coming up with ideas and forming teams (unless you want to compete on your own, which is fine). The guidelines are straightforward: you have 2 days to build something cool from scratch. It could be an app (web/mobile/desktop) or there could be a hardware component to it (e.g. robots). Feel free to run ideas past us: contact@uqcs.org.au

The aim is to have something that works by Sunday afternoon. There will be assistance provided in the form of pizza, coffee, and friendly mentors. The Hackathon will be hosted in the ELCX (Hawken) and doors open 8am on Saturday. More info at the event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1739000776327147/

Good luck and enjoy the break.
