title: Welcome to UQCS in 2015
---
<p>The UQ Computing Society would like to welcome all our new members for 2015, and welcome back all our continuing members. To kick off this year's events, we invite you to our Welcome to UQCS event for 2015, which is free for all members.</p>

<p>At the event, we'll be introducing our 2015 Executive team, as well as introduce our upcoming events. It's the perfect chance to catch up with other computing students, and even make some new friends. And of course, an event like this wouldn't be complete without free pizza for all our members!</p>

<p>If you're not a member yet, we'll be accepting more registrations at our welcome events, so bring $5 on the day to become a member (and get your free pizza). Membership comes with a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/members2015.html">long list of benefits</a>, so don't miss out!</p>
