<p>Thanks to everyone who came along to either of our first 2 talks of the year - Intro to Latex, or Intro to Programming Contests.</p>
<p>We have links to both the slides for the Latex Talk, and the Programming Contest Solution files available - click 'read more'.

<p>UQCS especially thanks Dr Joel Fenwick for his presentation about LaTeX. The slides (which are the same as last year) are still available from our website, via the following link, and can be used as a reference to learn LaTeX.</p>

<p>From the programming contest talk, the demonstration files have been put into a zip. Don't forget that you can still download previous Code Jam solutions from the <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html">website</a>, as well as practice and learn from old contest analyses.</p>
<p>Code Jam DOES allow the use of previous code in a contest, so these may prove a good start!</p>
