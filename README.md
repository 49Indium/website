## Showcasing your project

Would you like to showcase your project? If so please produce a high
quality image of size 1000x750px and add it to `img/showcase/`.

Once you've produced the image add the below snippet to 
`_includes/showcase_content.html` replacing [Project Title], [URL], and
[Description] with your own information.

```
<div class="col s12 m6 l4">
  <div class="card small">
    <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light">
      <img class="activator" src="img/showcase/inciteful.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">
          [Project Title]
          <i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span>
      <p><a href="#">[URL]</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-reveal">
    <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">
        [Project Title]
        <i class="material-icons right">close</i>
    </span>
      <p>
        [Description]
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
